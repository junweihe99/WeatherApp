# WeatherApp
WeatherApp is an application designed to take an input location and display the weather status of the said location. The overall structure of the website was set up using HTML and CSS. JavaScript was used to set up 'click' functionality with the submit button and to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

<h4>Challenges</h4>
